### Application for the Analysis of machine learning algorithms on different datasets 
The datasets used are : Iris, Breast Cancer and Wine dataset from scikit-learn datasets
The datasets are trained on the models KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier, RandomForestClassifer and SupportVectorMachine(SVM)
The performance of all three datasets can be compared and the best model can be chosen for the dataset.
